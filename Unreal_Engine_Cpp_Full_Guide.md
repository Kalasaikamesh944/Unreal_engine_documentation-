## Introduction

Unreal Engine provides a robust framework for developing games using C++. It enables fine-grained control over gameplay mechanics, rendering, and optimization. This guide consolidates the knowledge required for efficient Unreal Engine development.

---

## Setting Up Unreal Engine for C++

### Prerequisites

- Install **Visual Studio** (2022 or later recommended).
- Download and install **Unreal Engine** via the Epic Games Launcher.

### Steps to Start

1. Open Unreal Engine.
2. Create a new project by selecting the **C++** template.
3. Configure project settings and directory paths.
4. Click **Create** to set up your project.

## Game Framework Overview

The Unreal Engine Game Framework includes:

1. **GameModeBase**: Defines rules and the overall game flow.
2. **PlayerController**: Handles player input and interactions.
3. **Pawn/Character**: Represents entities controlled by the player or AI.
4. **GameState**: Manages state shared among all players.

```cpp
// Example: Creating a Custom GameMode
#include "GameFramework/GameModeBase.h"
#include "MyGameMode.generated.h"

UCLASS()
class MYGAME_API AMyGameMode : public AGameModeBase
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    AMyGameMode();
};
```

## Key Concepts and Examples

### Creating Actors

Actors are the basic building blocks in Unreal Engine. They can represent objects, environments, or gameplay logic.

```cpp
#include "GameFramework/Actor.h"
#include "MyActor.generated.h"

UCLASS()
class MYGAME_API AMyActor : public AActor
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    AMyActor();

protected:
    virtual void BeginPlay() override;

public:
    virtual void Tick(float DeltaTime) override;
};
```

### Input Handling

Input mappings allow players to interact with the game.

```cpp
void AMyCharacter::SetupPlayerInputComponent(UInputComponent* PlayerInputComponent)
{
    Super::SetupPlayerInputComponent(PlayerInputComponent);
    PlayerInputComponent->BindAxis("MoveForward", this, &AMyCharacter::MoveForward);
}

void AMyCharacter::MoveForward(float Value)
{
    AddMovementInput(GetActorForwardVector(), Value);
}
```

### UI Development

Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG) enables the creation of user interfaces.

1. Add a Widget Blueprint in the Content Browser.
2. Design UI elements using the Widget Editor.
3. Use the widget in C++:

```cpp
#include "Blueprint/UserWidget.h"

UCLASS()
class MYGAME_API UMyUserWidget : public UUserWidget
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
};
```

---

## Advanced Topics

### Networking

Unreal Engine uses a client-server model for multiplayer games.

- **Replication**: Synchronize data between server and clients.

```cpp
UPROPERTY(Replicated)
int32 Health;
```

- **Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)**: Execute functions across the network.

```cpp
UFUNCTION(Server, Reliable)
void ServerUpdateHealth(int32 NewHealth);
```

### AI Systems

Unreal's AI system uses Behavior Trees and Blackboards for complex logic.

```cpp
#include "BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.h"
#include "AIController.h"

UCLASS()
class MYGAME_API AMyAIController : public AAIController
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    void BeginPlay() override;
};
```
